# Code examples

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.
For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

```
function sumTwoSmallestNumbers(numbers) {
  function compareNumbers(a, b) {
  if (a > b) return 1;
  if (a == b) return 0;
  if (a < b) return -1;
}
 const resultsSort = numbers.sort(compareNumbers);
 return numbers[0] + numbers[1]
}
```
